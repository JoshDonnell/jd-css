/**
	* This is where all of the project colours are set up,
	* we have a simple process to follow for generating the 
	* colours. The first step is to go to the following url:
	* https://colordesigner.io/what-color-is-this
	*
	* Before we enter our hex codes we need to chnage the list
	* type be NTC.
	*
	* Once we have done this we can get out colour names
	* from this website, just enter the hex code of your
	* colour and it will return a name such as Milano Red.
	*
	* Now we have this name we will create a new variable
	* with this name in the default colours section under
	* $black and $white. For example we would create:
	* $milano-red: #C11010;
	*
	* Then in our Brand colours we will set the two most
	* commonly used colours to be primary and secondary,
	* for example:
	* $colour-primary: $milano-red;
	* $colour-secondary: $ultramarine;

/* Colours
* 
* Our projects colour pallet, please see above on how to 
* create the pallet.
*
* 1. Do not remove these two, $black and $white are required,
*    You can however change there hex codes.

$black: #000; /* [1] */
$white: #fff; /* [1] */





/* Brand Colours
* 
* These are the most commonly used colours in our project and
* are specfic to the brand we are working for, see above on
* how these are set.
